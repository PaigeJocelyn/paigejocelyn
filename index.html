                I'm Paige Jocelyn, a wife, mother and proud trans woman. 
                In my free time I review some of the hottest hotsauces around on YouTube. 
                I am also an accomplished musician, having played in many professional bands.
                I am also teaching myself full stack web development through the Odin Project and Udemy.
                After twenty years of sales and business experience, I have decided it was time for a change. 
                I hope you enjoy my personal website and the projects that I've linked here as I explore web dev. :3
